# Civlabs Public Source Code Releases

This source code is provided without warrenty and will almost always be outdated. The current release is from Event 4, and is considered stable (enough). We will review bug reports only, if you want to add features to the main civlabs server you should ask to join the team in our discord (:
Feel free to try make derivitive servers or other projects, but keep in mind the LICENSE. Essentially you agree that if you clone and modify and then distribute this codebase, weather it be making a new plugin ontop of ours, or modifying our plugin on a publically accessible server, you **must**:
- Credit Civlabs and back to the origional github and / or discord.
- Your code must also be open source fully, even if its for your own server.
- The current LICENSE file has to be transfered to the new project unmodified.

These decisions were made to protect the time investment of civlabs devs and the hope rhat the community can continue to make better and more unique projects then the civlabs team could.
Merry christmas!
- Civlabs
